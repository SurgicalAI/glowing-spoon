With an  innovative & efficient data annotation & labelling I have helped the Health Tech  company to accelerate AI development to operating room also in robotic assisted surgery. My Vision it will always be  to provide the highest quality data sets using my surgical experience . My Mission  it will always be to provide a pivotal service that allows surgical teams  to focus on their core (AI/ML) patient safety, while I create the data sets that is  needed to power the algorithms.
I am an articulate self-motivated individual, who has exemplary organisational skills, is highly efficient and has a good eye for detail.
